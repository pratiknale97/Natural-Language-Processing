# Natural-Language-Processing

-> PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The mostly named emerging trend in AI for 2020 had been NLP. It is curious to see machines interact the same way humans do. 
Language-based translator, dynamic bots for query resolution, key document classifiers, Process error identifiers etc. have been picked up to be
game changes of application of NLP. This project will be focusing on how to deal with text-based data and identify patterns for classification and
also understand working on time-based and continuous data to master approaches in resolving business problems which involve the same.

-> PROJECT OBJECTIVE

1. Work with Text
2. Understand & appreciate Language-based Models
3. Build Text-based analysers
4. Work on sequential Data 
5. Perform time series using Sequential models
 

-> PROJECT PREREQUISITES

1. Well versed with basic Neural Net concept and design
2. Students should hold thorough knowledge of all Machine learning algorithms
3. Knowledge of Mathematical functions & Linear Algebra (Refer to pre-work for deep learning)
4. Knowledge of Python is very crucial
